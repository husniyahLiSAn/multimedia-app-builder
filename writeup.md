# Explanation of My Multimedia App

I have implemented two additional features in the Multimedia Web App: file upload and duplication. Here's how they work:

1. File Upload: Users can select a file from their local system using the file input button. Once the file is selected, the `handleFileUpload` function is triggered, which retrieves the selected file and sets it as the `selectedFile` state. When the user clicks the "Upload" button, the `setFileUpload` function is called. It reads the content of the selected file using `FileReader` and creates metadata for the uploaded file. The metadata, including the file name, type, and path, is added to the `myFiles` state, and an alert message is displayed to notify the user that the file has been uploaded.

2. File Duplication: Users can duplicate a selected file by clicking the "Duplicate" button. In the `onClick` event handler, it checks if a file is selected (`selectedFile`). If a file is selected, a new object called `duplicatedFile` is created by spreading the properties of the selected file. The `id` property is set to a unique value by incrementing the length of `myFiles` array, and the `name` property is modified by appending " - Copy" to the original file name. The `duplicatedFile` object is then added to the `myFiles` state, effectively duplicating the file in the application.

I chose these two features because they enhance the functionality and user experience of the Multimedia Web App. The file upload feature allows users to add their own multimedia files to the app, expanding the range of supported content. This enables users to have a more personalized and diverse collection of files. The file duplication feature provides a convenient way for users to create copies of files within the app. It can be helpful when users want to make variations or backups of their existing files without the need to re-upload them.

Regarding the code, the file upload feature uses the FileReader API to read the content of the selected file, and the metadata for the uploaded file is stored in the `myFiles` state. The file duplication feature creates a duplicate of the selected file by copying its properties and modifying certain values. The duplicated file is then added to the `myFiles` state, effectively duplicating the file in the app. These features improve the overall functionality of the Multimedia Web App by allowing users to upload their own files and create duplicates easily.
